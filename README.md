## Installation
- Grab latest release from [here](https://casterlabs.co).

## For developers
- Make sure you have electron-builder to compile the app
- To install electron-builder you have to run the command ```npm  install electron-builder -g```
```elm
git clone https://github.com/thehelvijs/Caffeinated  
cd app  
npm install  
electron-builder -wl
```
- MacOS builds do still need to be made the same way on macos but with ```-m``` instead of ```-wl```

- Magic

## Troubleshooting
- If nothing appears on alert test
  - Open web browser (preferably Chrome), copy link there and test again. If nothing happens, go to Caffeinated settings and change local host port (e.g. 3000), restart Caffeinated and change link to that port, test again.

## Known issues
- If more localhost links are open, audio plays for every window and becomes distorted/loud. Have to limit to 1 window.
- Overlapping alerts - a delay has to be set so all alerts play after previous one has finished.

## For developers
- Make sure you have electron-builder to compile the app
- To install electron-builder you have to run the command ```npm  install electron-builder -g```
```elm
git clone https://github.com/thehelvijs/Caffeinated  
cd app  
npm install  
electron-builder -wl
```
- MacOS builds do still need to be made the same way on macos but with ```-m``` instead of ```-wl```
